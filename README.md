# WhatsApp Clone - Responsive Design

Welcome to the **WhatsApp Clone** project! This project is a fully responsive replica of the popular messaging app WhatsApp, created using just **HTML** and **CSS**. The design adapts to different screen sizes, providing an optimized experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Features
- **Responsive layout**: The design adjusts smoothly to different screen sizes using CSS media queries.
- **User interface replication**: Modeled closely after WhatsApp's UI, with chat lists, message windows, and a message input area.
- **Pure HTML & CSS**: No JavaScript or frameworks involved, just clean and structured code.

## Usage
Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser to see the WhatsApp clone in action.

```bash

# Clone the repository

# Open the index.html file in your browser (for macOS)
